      "4. In a large bowl, mix the nuruk and yeast with water until dissolved.\n",
      "5. Add the cooked rice to the bowl and mix well.\n",
      "6. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let it ferment in a warm place for 3-4 days.\n",
      "7. After fermentation, strain the mixture through a cheesecloth to remove any solids.\n",
      "8. Transfer the liquid to a clean container and let it sit for another 1-2 days to allow the flavors to develop.\n",
      "9. Your homemade soju is now ready to be enjoyed! Serve chilled and enjoy responsibly. Ingredients:\n",
      "- 3 cups all-purpose flour\n",

      "1. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.\n",
      "2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.\n",
      "3. Mix everything together until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n",
      "4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.\n",
      "5. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place it in a greased loaf pan.\n",
      "6. Cover the loaf with a clean towel and let it rise for another 30-45 minutes.\n",
      "7. Bake the bread in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n",
      "8. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool before slicing and serving. Enjoy your homemade bread! \n",
